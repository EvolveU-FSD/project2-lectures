Ingredients
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
2-1/4 cups warm water (110째 to 115째)
3 tablespoons sugar plus 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups bread flour

Directions
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in warm water; 
let stand until bubbles form on surface. 
Whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, salt and 3 cups flour. 
Stir oil into yeast mixture; 
pour into flour mixture and beat until smooth. 
Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; 
knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes. 
Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. 
Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
Punch dough down. 
Turn onto a lightly floured surface; 
divide dough in half. 
Shape each into a loaf. 
Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. loaf pans. 
Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
Bake at 375째 until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped or has reached an internal temperature of 200째, 30-35 minutes. 
Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
